## Hypothesis
If a restaurant has a poor health inspection score, they will also have a low rating on yelp or google.

| Inspection Score  | Interpretation    |
| ------------------|:-----------------:|
| >90               | Good              |
| 86-90             | Adequate          |
| 71-85             | Needs improvement |
| <= 70             | poor              |

## Null-Hypothesis
If a restaurant has a poor health inspection score they will not also have a low rating on yelp or google.

## Solution
[Instructions to execute the code]

- [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process

- [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**

- [ ] Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)

- [ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation

- [x] Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions

- [ ] Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
