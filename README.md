# Dallas Restaurant Food Inspection Ratings
Please see the [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19vpMZBbfNXPX9-6Qe1YxKYzE8sal83Mh1qw5A7lPuxI/edit#slide=id.p) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kirpatrick/dallas-restaurant-analysis/blob/master/dallas_restaurant_analysis.ipynb) for detailed findings and analysis.
### SMU Data Science Bootcamp:  Project 1
Do restaurants with low health inspection scores tend to receive lower customer ratings in Yelp and Google?

| Inspection Score  | Interpretation    |
| ------------------|:-----------------:|
| >90               | Good              |
| 86-90             | Adequate          |
| 71-85             | Needs improvement |
| <= 70             | poor              |

## Null-hypothesis: There is no expected relationship between the review a restaurant receives on Yelp or Google and the health inspection score that they receive. 

## Alternative-hypothesis: There is an expected positive relationship between the review a restaurant receives on Yelp or Google and the health inspection score that they receive.

## Solution
1. Acquire the following API Keys:
    - [Google](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)
    - [Yelp Fusion](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)
2. Install 'Tech Stack' dependencies.
3. Clone this repository to your machine.
4. Unzip [Restaurant_and_Food_Establishment_Inspections__October_2016_to_Present_.xlsx](https://github.com/kirpatrick/dallas-restaurant-analysis/blob/master/resources/Restaurant_and_Food_Establishment_Inspections__October_2016_to_Present_.zip) and save in the resources folder.
5. Open [dallas_restaurant_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/kirpatrick/dallas-restaurant-analysis/blob/master/dallas_restaurant_analysis.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook.
6. Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook starting at the top.

<b>NOTE:</b>  Some dependencies provide the option to (1) Limit data query calls (helpful when making numerous calls to Google and Yelp), (2) to load resources from outside the code, or to (3) load data from a previously generated data frame to continue execution.  Look for these options when you see *'Transition data to use...'*.
